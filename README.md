## Tahoma Monastery

This project creates a web app that allows people to apply for retreats online once they sign up on the site.

Devise RubyGem is used for authentication.

ActionMailer is used so that when the user submits their online application they will receive an email confirmation and a copy of their application.  

All the user and application details are stored in the database.  Applicants will then be able to access their accounts to see the status of their application.
